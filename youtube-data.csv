I Will Not Let An Exam Result Decide My Fate - Suli Breaks\,Vanity Fair\,2009  ""I Will Not Let An Exam Result Decide My Fate"" picks up on the education topic but takes a different stance and angle from ""Why I Hate School But Love Education"". This poem talks about how we have been made to think about how education and getting university degrees can give us opportunities to have a better chance in making our dream careers a reality. It also touches on how as individuals we are judged and tested by how well we perform on exams\, but not all people perform well in exams so why are they made out to feel like they're dumb? The inconsistencies of the education system are really peeled open to reveal a deep problem that needs to be addressed and how society's needs have changed to make this even more apparent.  When it boils down to it\, why are we misled into thinking that education is the only way forward for successful means in our work and career lives? We need to open our minds and educate ourselves that exam results aren't the barometer of success and that we can't let them decide our fate. We are in charge of our own destinies!

kn2-d5a3r94,Minecraft,2010-09-27T23:07:41Z,Building Megaobjects in Minecraft,"This is the beginning framework of the Enterprise - D in Minecraft ----- (Nine year edit) There is a Discord server and Facebook page now... Discord : https://discord.gg/X75uXny Facebook :  https://facebook.com/MineTrek Say ""Hi"" for me :) -----    I didn't think this would go viral so quickly! It's not even done and on top of that\, the Minecraft servers are down so I can't put it up...  Some quick answers to some questions. Thanks for all the warm kudos. I'll take some time to tell you guys about how I made the ship and what my plans are for it.  I've always wanted to make a 1:1 scale model of the Enterprise-D. Even when I was a kid\, I thought how cool it would be to build the ship and live in it. One project I embarked on about a year ago was to build a 1:1 scale model of the enterprise in Sketchup. I got pretty far too.  Sadly\, my hard drive blew and I lost six months of work. The only thing I had was my original framework and It was just too painful to start over. One of the things that was not lost was the deck plans and a nice computer-friendly vector format\, converted from the Whitefire plans (Not the Okuda ones). The plans are pretty rough\, but workable. One day I need to go through and clean them up.  The Minecraft world uses 1m^3 blocks\, ans so\, I simply converted my already scaled plans into a format that minecraft could take and imported each deck in batch\, leaving 4 spaces in between for walls  The original Enterprise is 642.5 Meters x 467.0 Meters x 137.5 Meters. This is about 3m per deck. Sadly\, with the 1m deck you have to walk on\, that only leaves 2m left over for hallway space. As your character is only 1.7m tall\, you will be bumping your head around a lot. I decided to make the ship 22% bigger\, so I could have 4 m per deck. That puts the final size @ 785m x 570m x 168m. I made my ""pit"" 800x600x180 to fit all 42 decks and almost made a critical error. Even though there are 42 decks on the enterprise\, the 2nd deck is split into two half-decks\, making actually 43. I made the pit bigger than she ship so I could have a little wiggle room and just missed making it too shallow. In my testing\, the halls can get a little cramped. The current decks are just a guideline and framework. They don't call it ""Creative Mode"" for nothing.  The halls are going to be sand-obsidian-sand (To give that light brown look with the black touch panel in the center) I'd show a demo\, but Minecraft is down. I would like to mod my server so that sand doesn't fall. That would bee cool. I also don't know how to fly yet\, will be making it much easier to work on the ship.  This is on a creative server. I would love to put it on Alpha\, but Notch limits the game depth to 128m now\, which is 40m too shallow. I'll lose 10 decks. Maybe I can convince him to up the limit to 256m with the project  There are still some things to work out.  1) I need to turn flying on. 2) I need to model and import the warp nacelles\, just so I have the framework there. 3) I need to make a dirt floor so people can start building scaffolding from the bottom. (You can't plant blocks on Adminium) 4) I would live to get rid of the Admininum walls. 5) I should put this online so people can help. I need to come up with a pretty solid anti-griefing policy and need many like-minded people so I don't wind up with cocks in the shuttlebays.

Disabling comments for a bit so I can read over all of the 2\,000 that I missed.   UPDATE 2/27/12 Yes I do read every comment. Yes I do delete comments that just repeat statements.  UPDATE 7/26/11 Wow\, I have been getting about 20 comments an hour nowadays\, which raises suspicion due to a viewcount that isnt 20 an hour. I think some people are only watching 20 seconds of the video and then commenting. I would appreciate it if all of you watched ALL of the video WITH THE ANNOTATIONS ON.

I still to this day have no explanation. I would appreciate it if people stopped pointing it out. I get about 10-20 comments a day\, about half of which are just about that. Thank you for reading.  UPDATE 5/8/11: Feel free to make video responses\, I'll allow almost all of them.   UPDATE 4/9/11: Notch has confirmed in the past he has never had any brother\, please stop commenting about Notch having a brother.  Yes\, we will be making more herobrine stuff\, we have had some more sightings\, I recently had been having problems with youtube. Expect more by Summer.  Heres the whole story:  While playing with my friend on Minecraft\, my friend said he had to go. He did this a lot. One strange thing though was after he left\, the black boxes in the sky appeared. They came closer and closer. Soon I was confronted by a strange skinned man. He shot a bow at me\, and it hurt. The weird thing is\, you cant take damage in this game mode. Let alone hurt another player.  Seeing it as a hacker I ran. When I went up after he was gone\, a lot of things were broken.

This must have taken ages to make something as awesome as this.  Director: http://www.youtube.com/user/JamSessionEin ___________________________________ From the author:  720p quality strongly recommended.  Video of one of the Penny Arcade community's servers!  By now the Cult of Rapture server has made its rounds on the internet and gotten all of the attention it well and truly deserved. However\, back when I first set the minecraft server up\, most of us hadn't caught wind of it yet\, so we set about making Rapture on our own.  We were not trying to precisely duplicate Rapture. Given that the build server regularly hosts 30+ people\, trying to precisely recreate a game that some might not have played didn't seem like a worthwhile endeavor. What we did\, instead\, was try and retain the flavor of Rapture\, while still enjoying the process of making our own original creations. Obviously\, this means we have structures that did not exist in the game - such as our giant Surface Recreation Dome\, which is one of the main hubs of the city. With that said\, we're still tremendously proud of our accomplishments so far\, so we put this video together to celebrate our current progress.  I just want to emphasize that all of the construction on the map is done by hand. Nothing was editor'd in. Admins and mods on the main build server do spawn blocks for people when needed\, but only for things that can't otherwise by regularly attained such as ice blocks or lava. If they want any gold\, diamond\, rock\, whatever\, that is regularly available in the map\, it's up to the player to get it.  For the record\, these two videos only walk through about 2/3rds of what we've built down here. :P There's some places I totally forgot to wander through\, like Siren Alley. Maybe we'll do a second run-through in few weeks.",MinecraftContent,"['MinecraftContent', 'Minecraft', 'Bioshock', 'City', 'of', 'Rapture', 'Welcome', 'to', 'Part', 'Content', 'Cinema', 'Media', 'Videos', 'Mods', 'Funny', 'Creative', 'Hard', 'Impressive', 'Commentaries', 'Gameplay', 'Server', 'Work']",20,,PT12M28S,hd,false,False,156113,1202,0,251,False,"['https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Action-adventure_game', 'https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Role-playing_video_game', 'https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Simulation_video_game', 'https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Video_game_culture']",,

It's about time that I find a diamond Hope the diamond doesn't mind when I mine it.  (when I find the) Diamond\, diamond\, I'll mine a diamond (when I find the) Diamond\, diamond\, if I could find one. (when I find the) Diamond\, diamond\, I'll mine a diamond Hope the diamond doesn't mind when I mine it.  What would you do with the diamonds? Put em on a stick. Why would you do that to diamonds? To make a diamond pic. How do you fuse all the diamonds? I put em on a table in a certain pattern depending on the item that I want to make A table. With a click diamond items get made. With a table. A diamond pick axe in this case. A table can't do that.  How can a table do that? Cause it's a table of crafting. It's how we all craft things. But how's it bend diamond? Cause that's what it has to do. So I can forge the most ultimate tool. It's about time that I find a diamond. It's about time that I mind the diamond It's about time that I find a diamond Hope the diamond doesn't mind when I mine it. So I break through the rock. Cut through block after block And I finally find what I'm destined to mine I raise up my pickaxing arm one more time As soon as I make sure it's cool with the diamond. Diamond\, would you mind if I mined you? Answer me or I'll think you don't mind my pickaxe cutting through you. I hear no objection\, time to get to mining\, mining\, I mine the diamond. Mining\, mining\, I mine the diamond. Mining\, mini.... AAHHHH.   My pickaxe broke.  So i'll mine the diamond with my hand my hand i'll mine the diamond with my hand my hand Dude\, you can't mine diamond with your hand it just dsappears. What's that?  It disa... OHH NOOO!!!

Part exploratory adventure\, part creative building tool\, ""Minecraft"" evolved from a cult classic into an unprecedented hit\, raking daily sales in by the thousands. By the end of 2010\, Notch was able to quit his day job and live the dream of founding his own development studio\, Mojang.   This feature-length documentary follows the young company over the course of its first year as their profile expands across the world stage and into the homes of millions of gamers. Featuring insights from industry icons (Peter Molyneux\, Tim Schafer)\, journalists (Geoff Keighley\, Stephen Totilo)\, tastemakers (Gabe & Tycho of Penny Arcade)\, and players profoundly impacted by the game (Yogscast\, The Shaft\, Minecraft Teacher)\, the film serves as a time capsule for one of this generation's most unorthodox success stories.  Minecraft: The Story of Mojang is the second feature from game culture archivists 2 Player Productions (Reformat the Planet\, Penny Arcade: The Series - Season 1\, Double Fine Adventure!). Funded through crowdsourcing site Kickstarter.com\, the production spanned nearly two years in locations across North America and Europe.",2PlayerProductions,"['coding', 'with', 'notch', 'minecraft', 'documentary', 'mojang', 'markus', 'exploding', 'arrows']",20,,PT3M57S,hd,false,False,5746495,95894,0,13759,False,"['https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Action-adventure_game', 'https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Role-playing_video_game', 'https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Video_game_culture']",,

1CDlBLvc3YE,Movie Scenes,2011-11-22T17:01:17Z,The Baptism Murders - The Godfather (8/9) Movie CLIP (1972) HD,"The Godfather movie clips: http://j.mp/1uunTSY BUY THE MOVIE: http://amzn.to/t8JpGl Don't miss the HOTTEST NEW TRAILERS: http://bit.ly/1u2y6pr  CLIP DESCRIPTION: Michael (Al Pacino) has a series of hits executed while he is at a baptism.  FILM DESCRIPTION: Popularly viewed as one of the best American films ever made\, the multi-generational crime saga The Godfather is a touchstone of cinema: one of the most widely imitated\, quoted\, and lampooned movies of all time. Marlon Brando and Al Pacino star as Vito Corleone and his youngest son\, Michael\, respectively. It is the late 1940s in New York and Corleone is\, in the parlance of organized crime\, a ""godfather"" or ""don\,"" the head of a Mafia family. Michael\, a free thinker who defied his father by enlisting in the Marines to fight in World War II\, has returned a captain and a war hero. Having long ago rejected the family business\, Michael shows up at the wedding of his sister\, Connie (Talia Shire)\, with his non-Italian girlfriend\, Kay (Diane Keaton)\, who learns for the first time about the family ""business."" A few months later at Christmas time\, the don barely survives being shot by gunmen in the employ of a drug-trafficking rival whose request for aid from the Corleones' political connections was rejected. After saving his father from a second assassination attempt\, Michael persuades his hotheaded eldest brother\, Sonny (James Caan)\, and family advisors Tom Hagen (Robert Duvall) and Sal Tessio (Abe Vigoda) that he should be the one to exact revenge on the men responsible. After murdering a corrupt police captain and the drug trafficker\, Michael hides out in Sicily while a gang war erupts at home. Falling in love with a local girl\, Michael marries her\, but she is later slain by Corleone enemies in an attempt on Michael's life. Sonny is also butchered\, having been betrayed by Connie's husband. As Michael returns home and convinces Kay to marry him\, his father recovers and makes peace with his rivals\, realizing that another powerful don was pulling the strings behind the narcotics endeavor that began the gang warfare. Once Michael has been groomed as the new don\, he leads the family to a new era of prosperity\, then launches a campaign of murderous revenge against those who once tried to wipe out the Corleones\, consolidating his family's power and completing his own moral downfall. Nominated for 11 Academy Awards and winning for Best Picture\, Best Actor (Marlon Brando)\, and Best Adapted Screenplay\, The Godfather was followed by a pair of sequels.

FILM DESCRIPTION: Director John Singleton's debut chronicles the trials and tribulations of three young African-American males growing up in South Central Los Angeles. When young Tre (Cuba Gooding Jr.)\, a bright underachiever\, begins to show signs of trouble\, his struggling professional mother (Angela Basset) sends him to live with his father (Lawrence Fishburne)\, a hard-nosed\, no-nonsense disciplinarian. There he befriends Ricky (Morris Chestnut)\, a burgeoning football star\, and Doughboy (Ice Cube\, in a standout performance)\, a would-be gang banger. Over the years\, each chooses his own path: Tre seems bound for college; Ricky is a blue-chip running back with his pick of schools; Doughboy is a dope dealer and bona fide gangster who drifts in and out of the county juvenile facility. All is well until\, without warning\, a rival gang chases down Tre and Ricky with tragic results. Doughboy immediately prepares for revenge\, forcing Tre to decide whether to jeopardize his future and\, perhaps\, his life for the price of revenge and self-respect. Sometimes riveting\, Boyz'N the Hood is not without its problems. The film tries to cram every single issue facing the black community into an hour and a half of screen time\, making the film seem at times forced. The symbolism seems forced as well\, and the film is often unbearably heavy-handed. Also\, the characterization often relies on cardboard cut-outs; every white character in the film is a one-dimensional bigot\, and the black police officer with whom Tre and his father deal is even worse than his Caucasian counterparts. Still\, the unevenness of the film is redeemed by some moments of true brilliance.  CREDITS: TM & © Sony (1991) Cast: Morris Chestnut\, Ice Cube\, Dedrick D.

FILM DESCRIPTION: Walter Hill's hip\, super-stylized action film unfurls in a dystopian near-future\, when various gangs control New York City. Each gang sports a unique moniker ('The Warriors\,' 'The Baseball Furies\,' 'The Rogues')\, with a costume underscoring its ""theme""; each\, in turn\, is also responsible for one geographic area. Hill sets up the landscape as a massive\, violent playground - replete with bridges\, vacant subway tunnels\, parks\, abandoned buildings and the like\, all ripe for exploration and adventure. As the tale opens\, the titular Coney Island has traveled to the Bronx to attend a city-wide meeting of all gangs; at that event\, however\, the psychotic leader of a rival gang\, The Rogues (David Patrick Kelly of Dreamscape) assassinates the head of the city's foremost gang\, but The Warriors are pegged as culpable. This sends the gang fleeing through the labyrinthine city. With every thug in Manhattan in vicious\, homicidal pursuit\, they must also overcome all obstacles in their way. Throughout\, Hill keeps the onscreen violence absurd\, exaggerated and unrealistic\, downplaying death to an extreme degree; despite this fact\, the film sparked a massive amount of controversy and an ugly backlash for allegedly inciting violence and destruction in several theaters where it initially played. James Remar\, Michael Beck and Deborah Van Valkenburgh lead the ensemble cast.

Cobb) finally breaks down and pronounces ""Not Guilty.""  FILM DESCRIPTION: A Puerto Rican youth is on trial for murder\, accused of knifing his father to death. The twelve jurors retire to the jury room\, having been admonished that the defendant is innocent until proven guilty beyond a reasonable doubt. Eleven of the jurors vote for conviction\, each for reasons of his own. The sole holdout is Juror #8\, played by Henry Fonda. As Fonda persuades the weary jurors to re-examine the evidence\, we learn the backstory of each man. Juror #3 (Lee J. Cobb)\, a bullying self-made man\, has estranged himself from his own son. Juror #7 (Jack Warden) has an ingrained mistrust of foreigners; so\, to a lesser extent\, does Juror #6 (Edward Binns). Jurors #10 (Ed Begley) and #11 (George Voskovec)\, so certain of the infallibility of the Law\, assume that if the boy was arrested\, he must be guilty. Juror #4 (E.G. Marshall) is an advocate of dispassionate deductive reasoning. Juror #5 (Jack Klugman)\, like the defendant a product of ""the streets\,"" hopes that his guilty vote will distance himself from his past. Juror #12 (Robert Webber)\, an advertising man\, doesn't understand anything that he can't package and market. And Jurors #1 (Martin Balsam)\, #2 (John Fiedler) and #9 (Joseph Sweeney)\, anxious not to make waves\, ""go with the flow."" The excruciatingly hot day drags into an even hotter night; still\, Fonda chips away at the guilty verdict\, insisting that his fellow jurors bear in mind those words ""reasonable doubt."" A pet project of Henry Fonda's\, Twelve Angry Men was his only foray into film production; the actor's partner in this venture was Reginald Rose\, who wrote the 1954 television play on which the film was based. Carried over from the TV version was director Sidney Lumet\, here making his feature-film debut. A flop when it first came out (surprisingly\, since it cost almost nothing to make)\, Twelve Angry Men holds up beautifully when seen today. It was remade for television in 1997 by director William Friedkin with Jack Lemmon and George C. Scott.  CREDITS: TM & © MGM (1957) Cast: Martin Balsam\, Ed Begley\, Ed Binns\, Lee J.

First and foremost\, you don't talk about Fight Club.  FILM DESCRIPTION: In this darkly comic drama\, Edward Norton stars as a depressed young man (named in the credits only as ""Narrator"") who has become a small cog in the world of big business. He doesn't like his work and gets no sense of reward from it\, attempting instead to drown his sorrows by putting together the ""perfect"" apartment. He can't sleep and feels alienated from the world at large; he's become so desperate to relate to others that he's taken to visiting support groups for patients with terminal diseases so that he'll have people to talk to. One day on a business flight\, he discovers Tyler Durden (Brad Pitt)\, a charming iconoclast who sells soap. Tyler doesn't put much stock in the materialistic world\, and he believes that one can learn a great deal through pain\, misfortune\, and chaos. Tyler cheerfully challenges his new friend to a fight. Our Narrator finds that bare-knuckle brawling makes him feel more alive than he has in years\, and soon the two become friends and roommates\, meeting informally to fight once a week. As more men join in\, the ""fight club"" becomes an underground sensation\, even though it's a closely guarded secret among the participants. (First rule: Don't talk about fight club. Second rule: Don't talk about fight club.) But as our Narrator and Tyler bond through violence\, a strange situation becomes more complicated when Tyler becomes involved with Marla (Helena Bonham Carter)\, whom our Narrator became infatuated with when they were both crashing the support-group circuit. Based on the novel by Chuck Palahniuk\, Fight Club was directed by David Fincher\, who previously directed Pitt in the thriller Seven.

FILM DESCRIPTION: A young pig fights convention to become a sheep dog -- or\, rather\, sheep pig -- in this charming Australian family film\, which became an unexpected international success due to superior special effects and an intelligent script. The title refers to the name bestowed on a piglet soon after his separation from his family\, when he finds himself on a strange farm. Confused and sad\, Babe is adopted by a friendly dog and slowly adjusts to his new home. Discovering that the fate of most pigs is the dinner table\, Babe devotes himself to becoming a useful member of the farm by trying to learn how to herd sheep\, despite the skepticism of the other animals and the kindly but conventional Farmer Hoggett (James Cromwell). Because technically impeccable animatronics and computer graphics allow the farm animals to converse easily among themselves\, first-time director Chris Noonan can treat the film's menagerie as actual characters\, playing scene not for cuteness but for real emotions. The result is often surprisingly touching\, with Noonan and George Miller's script\, based on Dick King-Smith's children's book and\, indirectly\, a true story\, seamlessly combining gentle whimsy and sincere feeling. These same qualities are embodied by in Cromwell's beautifully understated performance as Farmer Hoggett\, which anchors the film. Despite its unlikely premise and low profile\, Babe's inspirational story was embraced by audiences and critics\, and the movie became an international sleeper that won an Academy Award nomination for Best Picture. It was followed in 1999 by the less successful Babe: Pig in the City.

FILM DESCRIPTION: Gone With the Wind boils down to a story about a spoiled Southern girl's hopeless love for a married man. Producer David O. Selznick managed to expand this concept\, and Margaret Mitchell's best-selling novel\, into nearly four hours' worth of screen time\, on a then-astronomical 3.7-million-dollar budget\, creating what would become one of the most beloved movies of all time. Gone With the Wind opens in April of 1861\, at the palatial Southern estate of Tara\, where Scarlett O'Hara (Vivien Leigh) hears that her casual beau Ashley Wilkes (Leslie Howard) plans to marry ""mealy mouthed"" Melanie Hamilton (Olivia de Havilland). Despite warnings from her father (Thomas Mitchell) and her faithful servant Mammy (Hattie McDaniel)\, Scarlett intends to throw herself at Ashley at an upcoming barbecue at Twelve Oaks. Alone with Ashley\, she goes into a fit of histrionics\, all of which is witnessed by roguish Rhett Butler (Clark Gable)\, the black sheep of a wealthy Charleston family\, who is instantly fascinated by the feisty\, thoroughly self-centered Scarlett: ""We're bad lots\, both of us."" The movie's famous action continues from the burning of Atlanta (actually the destruction of a huge wall left over from King Kong) through the now-classic closing line\, ""Frankly\, my dear\, I don't give a damn."" Holding its own against stiff competition (many consider 1939 to be the greatest year of the classical Hollywood studios)\, Gone With the Wind won ten Academy Awards\, including Best Picture\, Best Director\, Best Screenplay\, Best Actress (Vivien Leigh)\, and Best Supporting Actress (Hattie McDaniel\, the first African-American to win an Oscar). The film grossed nearly 192 million dollars\, assuring that\, just as he predicted\, Selznick's epitaph would be ""The Man Who Made Gone With the Wind.""  CREDITS: TM & © Warner Bros.

FILM DESCRIPTION: In this multiple Oscar-winning thriller\, Jodie Foster stars as Clarice Starling\, a top student at the FBI's training academy whose shrewd analyses of serial killers lands her a special assignment: the FBI is investigating a vicious murderer nicknamed Buffalo Bill\, who kills young women and then removes the skin from their bodies. Jack Crawford (Scott Glenn) wants Clarice to interview Dr. Hannibal Lecter (Anthony Hopkins)\, a brilliant psychiatrist who is also a violent psychopath\, serving life behind bars for various acts of murder and cannibalism. Crawford believes that Lecter may have insight into this case and that Starling\, as an attractive young woman\, may be just the bait to draw him out. Lecter does indeed know something of Buffalo Bill\, but his information comes with a price: in exchange for telling what he knows\, he wants to be housed in a more comfortable facility. More important\, he wants to speak with Clarice about her past. He skillfully digs into her psyche\, forcing her to reveal her innermost traumas and putting her in a position of vulnerability when she can least afford to be weak. The film mingles the horrors of criminal acts with the psychological horrors of Lecter's slow-motion interrogation of Clarice and of her memories that emerge from it.

FILM DESCRIPTION: What if virtual reality wasn't just for fun\, but was being used to imprison you? That's the dilemma that faces mild-mannered computer jockey Thomas Anderson (Keanu Reeves) in The Matrix. It's the year 1999\, and Anderson (hacker alias: Neo) works in a cubicle\, manning a computer and doing a little hacking on the side. It's through this latter activity that Thomas makes the acquaintance of Morpheus (Laurence Fishburne)\, who has some interesting news for Mr. Anderson -- none of what's going on around him is real. The year is actually closer to 2199\, and it seems Thomas\, like most people\, is a victim of The Matrix\, a massive artificial intelligence system that has tapped into people's minds and created the illusion of a real world\, while using their brains and bodies for energy\, tossing them away like spent batteries when they're through. Morpheus\, however\, is convinced Neo is ""The One"" who can crack open The Matrix and bring his people to both physical and psychological freedom. The Matrix is the second feature film from the sibling writer/director team of Andy Wachowski and Larry Wachowski\, who made an impressive debut with the stylish erotic crime thriller Bound.

FILM DESCRIPTION: In an idealized New York City during the early '60s\, Holly Golightly (Audrey Hepburn) is a charming socialite with a youthful zest for life who lives alone in a nearly bare apartment. She has such a flippant lifestyle that she won't even give her cat a name\, because that would be too much of a commitment to a relationship. Maintaining a childlike innocence yet wearing the most perfect of designer clothes and accessories from Givenchy\, she spends her time on expensive dates and at high-class parties. She escorts various wealthy men\, yet fails to return their affections after they have given her gifts and money. Holly's carefree independence is changed when she meets her neighbor\, aspiring writer Paul (George Peppard)\, who is suffering from writer's block while being kept by a wealthy woman (Patricia Neal). Just when Holly and Paul are developing their sweet romance\, Doc (Buddy Ebsen) appears on the scene and complicates matters\, revealing the truth about Holly's past. Breakfast at Tiffany's was nominated for several Academy awards\, winning Best Score for Henry Mancini and Best Song for Johnny Mercer's classic tune ""Moon River"".

The film opens with the two strangers\, both newly graduated from the University of Chicago\, share a car trip from Chicago to New York\, where they are both going to make their way. During the trip\, they discuss aspects of their characters and their lives\, eventually deciding it is impossible for men and women to be ""just friends."" They arrive in New York and go their separate ways. They meet a few years later on an airplane and Harry reveals he is married. They meet again at a bookstore a few years after that where Harry reveals he is now divorced. From that point on\, the two form a friendship. Eventually their closeness results in their respective best friends (played by Carrie Fisher and Bruno Kirby) meeting and falling in love with each other. At a New Year's Eve party Harry and Sally confront the complex tangle of emotions they feel for each other. The soundtrack consists primarily of Harry Connick Jr. crooning standards like ""It Had to Be You.""

FILM DESCRIPTION: In 1960\, Alfred Hitchcock was already famous as the screen's master of suspense (and perhaps the best-known film director in the world) when he released Psycho and forever changed the shape and tone of the screen thriller. From its first scene\, in which an unmarried couple balances pleasure and guilt in a lunchtime liaison in a cheap hotel (hardly a common moment in a major studio film in 1960)\, Psycho announced that it was taking the audience to places it had never been before\, and on that score what followed would hardly disappoint. Marion Crane (Janet Leigh) is unhappy in her job at a Phoenix\, Arizona real estate office and frustrated in her romance with hardware store manager Sam Loomis (John Gavin). One afternoon\, Marion is given $40\,000 in cash to be deposited in the bank. Minutes later\, impulse has taken over and Marion takes off with the cash\, hoping to leave Phoenix for good and start a new life with her purloined nest egg. 36 hours later\, paranoia and exhaustion have started to set in\, and Marion decides to stop for the night at the Bates Motel\, where nervous but personable innkeeper Norman Bates (Anthony Perkins) cheerfully mentions that she's the first guest in weeks\, before he regales her with curious stories about his mother. There's hardly a film fan alive who doesn't know what happens next\, but while the shower scene is justifiably the film's most famous sequence\, there are dozens of memorable bits throughout this film. The first of a handful of sequels followed in 1983\, while Gus Van Sant's controversial remake\, starring Vince Vaughn and Anne Heche\, appeared in 1998.

FILM DESCRIPTION: Based on the story The Wisdom of Eve by Mary Orr\, All About Eve is an elegantly bitchy backstage story revolving around aspiring actress Eve Harrington (Anne Baxter). Tattered and forlorn\, Eve shows up in the dressing room of Broadway mega-star Margo Channing (Bette Davis)\, weaving a melancholy life story to Margo and her friends. Taking pity on the girl\, Margo takes Eve as her personal assistant. Before long\, it becomes apparent that nave Eve is a Machiavellian conniver who cold-bloodedly uses Margo\, her director Bill Sampson (Gary Merill)\, Lloyd's wife Karen (Celeste Holm)\, and waspish critic Addison De Witt (George Sanders) to rise to the top of the theatrical heap. Also appearing in All About Eve is Marilyn Monroe\, introduced by Addison De Witt as ""a graduate of the Copacabana school of dramatic art."" This is but one of the hundreds of unforgettable lines penned by writer/director Joseph L. Mankiewicz\, the most famous of which is Margo Channing's lip-sneering admonition\, ""Fasten your seat belts. It's going to be a bumpy night."" All About Eve received 6 Academy Awards\, including Best Picture.

FILM DESCRIPTION: ""All work and no play makes Jack a dull boy"" -- or\, rather\, a homicidal boy in Stanley Kubrick's eerie 1980 adaptation of Stephen King's horror novel. With wife Wendy (Shelley Duvall) and psychic son Danny (Danny Lloyd) in tow\, frustrated writer Jack Torrance (Jack Nicholson) takes a job as the winter caretaker at the opulently ominous\, mountain-locked Overlook Hotel so that he can write in peace. Before the Overlook is vacated for the Torrances\, the manager (Barry Nelson) informs Jack that a previous caretaker went crazy and slaughtered his family; Jack thinks it's no problem\, but Danny's ""shining"" hints otherwise. Settling into their routine\, Danny cruises through the empty corridors on his Big Wheel and plays in the topiary maze with Wendy\, while Jack sets up shop in a cavernous lounge with strict orders not to be disturbed. Danny's alter ego\, ""Tony\,"" however\, starts warning of ""redrum"" as Danny is plagued by more blood-soaked visions of the past\, and a blocked Jack starts visiting the hotel bar for a few visions of his own. Frightened by her husband's behavior and Danny's visit to the forbidding Room 237\, Wendy soon discovers what Jack has really been doing in his study all day\, and what the hotel has done to Jack.

FILM DESCRIPTION: Director Ridley Scott spins this yarn concerning a Harlem drug kingpin (Denzel Washington) who smuggles heroin into the country by hiding it in the bodies of U.S. soldiers killed during battle in Vietnam. There was a time when no one noticed reserved driver Frank Lucas (Washington)\, but when the criminal kingpin he was charged with transporting through the city streets suddenly dies\, Lucas seizes the opportunity to build his own criminal empire. In the following months\, Lucas solidifies his status as Harlem's most innovative drug dealer by delivering a product that is purer than the competitors' and cheaper\, as well. When innovative businessman Lukas attempts to go semi-legit by becoming one of the Manhattan borough's biggest civil supporters\, however\, street-savvy outcast cop Ritchie Roberts (Russell Crowe) begins to sense a sizable shift in the hierarchy of the drug underworld. But Roberts is one of the few honest detectives operating within a corrupt system\, and as he sets out to investigate the case\, crooked detective Trupo (Josh Brolin) does everything in his power to compromise the integrity of his idealistic counterpart. Upon clearing all of the usual Mafia-connected suspects\, Roberts begins to believe that a previously unknown black power player has come out of the woodwork to dominate the local drug trade. While Roberts and Lucas may be operating on opposite sides of the law\, the one thing that both men have in common is a strict code of ethics that separates them from their opportunistic colleagues. Now\, as a confrontation between the two men becomes inevitable and the fate of each becomes inexorably tied to the other\, it gradually becomes apparent that only one of them will emerge from the conflict victorious.

One early summer night on fictional Atlantic resort Amity Island\, Chrissie decides to take a moonlight skinny dip while her friends party on the beach. Yanked suddenly below the ocean surface\, she never returns. When pieces of her wash ashore\, Police Chief Brody (Roy Scheider) suspects the worst\, but Mayor Vaughn (Murray Hamilton)\, mindful of the lucrative tourist trade and the approaching July 4th holiday\, refuses to put the island on a business-killing shark alert. After the shark dines on a few more victims\, the Mayor orders the local fishermen to catch the culprit. Satisfied with the shark they find\, the greedy Mayor reopens the beaches\, despite the warning from visiting ichthyologist Hooper (Richard Dreyfuss) that the attacks were probably caused by a far more formidable Great White. One more fatality later\, Brody and Hooper join forces with flinty old salt Quint (Robert Shaw)\, the only local fisherman willing to take on a Great White--especially since the price is right. The three ride off on Quint's boat ""The Orca\,"" soon coming face to teeth with the enemy.

FILM DESCRIPTION: Rocky Balboa (Sylvester Stallone)\, a Philadelphia boxer\, is but one step removed from total bum-hood. A once-promising pugilist\, Rocky is now taking nickel-and-dime bouts and running strongarm errands for local loan sharks to survive. Even his supportive trainer\, Mickey (Burgess Meredith)\, has given up on Rocky. All this changes thanks to Muhammad Ali-like super-boxer Apollo Creed (Carl Weathers). With the Bicentennial celebration coming up\, Creed must find a ""Cinderella"" opponent for the big July 4th bout -- some unknown whom Creed can ""glorify"" for a few minutes before knocking him cold. Rocky Balboa was not the only Cinderella involved here: writer/director Sylvester Stallone\, himself a virtual unknown\, managed to sell his Rocky script (one of 35 that he'd written over the years) on the proviso that he be given the starring role. Since the film was to be made on a shoestring and marketed on a low-level basis\, the risk factor to United Artists was small. For Stallone\, this was a make-or-break opportunity -- just like Rocky's million-to-one shot with Apollo Creed. Costing under a million dollars\, Rocky managed to register with audiences everywhere\, earning back 60 times its cost. The film won several Academy Awards\, including Best Picture.

Jackson) loses his patience with Vincent (John Travolta) when he accidentally shoots Marvin (Phil LaMarr) in the face.  FILM DESCRIPTION: Outrageously violent\, time-twisting\, and in love with language\, Pulp Fiction was widely considered the most influential American movie of the 1990s. Director and co-screenwriter Quentin Tarantino synthesized such seemingly disparate traditions as the syncopated language of David Mamet; the serious violence of American gangster movies\, crime movies\, and films noirs mixed up with the wacky violence of cartoons\, video games\, and Japanese animation; and the fragmented story-telling structures of such experimental classics as Citizen Kane\, Rashomon\, and La jetée. The Oscar-winning script by Tarantino and Roger Avary intertwines three stories\, featuring Samuel L. Jackson and John Travolta\, in the role that single-handedly reignited his career\, as hit men who have philosophical interchanges on such topics as the French names for American fast food products; Bruce Willis as a boxer out of a 1940s B-movie; and such other stalwarts as Harvey Keitel\, Tim Roth\, Christopher Walken\, Eric Stoltz\, Ving Rhames\, and Uma Thurman\, whose dance sequence with Travolta proved an instant classic.

Through his unselfish activities\, over a thousand Jews on the trains to Auschwitz were saved. After Schindler found out what was happening at Auschwitz\, he began a systematic effort to save as many Jews as he could. For money\, he could buy Jews to work in his factory which was supposed to be a part of the military machine of Germany. On one hand he was buying as many Jews as he could\, and on the other hand he was deliberately sabotaging the ammunition produced in his factory. He entered the war as a financially wealthy industrialist; by the end of the war\, he was basically financially bankrupt.  When the Germans surrendered\, Schindler met with his workers and declared that at midnight they were all free to go. The most emotional scene of the film was when Schindler said good-bye to the financial manager of the plant\, a Jew and his good and trusted friend. As he embraced his friend\, Schindler sobbed and said\, ""I could have done more."" He looked at his automobile and asked\, ""Why did I save this? I could have bought 10 Jews with this.""

The terms are if Sebastian can de-virginize the headmaster's daughter then he gets to lay Kathryn. If Kathryn wins\, she gets Sebastian's classic Jaguar automobile.  FILM DESCRIPTION: In an adaptation of Choderlos de Laclos' novel\, Les Liaisons Dangereuses\, Kathryn Merteuil (Sarah Michelle Gellar) and Sebastian Valmont (Ryan Phillippe) are step-brother and step-sister living in Manhattan. With their absent parents travelling in Europe\, the wealthy pair have the family penthouse to themselves as they while away their summer break before beginning senior year at a private high school. Sebastian\, bad-boy lothario\, has apparently slept with all the girls in town and appears numb to it all. Kathryn\, who appears to be the good girl class president\, is actually far more amoral and malicious than Sebastian\, but maintains appearances to the contrary. When she is dumped by her boyfriend\, Court Reynolds (Charlie O'Connell)\, for the innocent Cecile Caldwell (Selma Blair)\, she schemes revenge by destroying Cecile's reputation. She challenges Sebastian to deflower Cecile and transform her into a tramp to humiliate Court. Sebastian isn't as interested as Cecile -- she's spent her whole life in a Catholic girl's school and presents no challenge. The girl who has caught his attention is Annette Hargrove (Reese Witherspoon)\, the new headmaster's daughter. Annette had written an article for Seventeen Magazine on her plans to stay a virgin until she finds her one true love. Kathryn makes a wager. If Sebastian fails to lure Annette into bed before the summer is over\, Kathryn gets his car. If he succeeds\, Sebastian gets Kathryn\, whom he wants anyway. Sebastian accepts the bet\, but Annette turns out to be more than either of them bargained for.

FILM DESCRIPTION: Director Spike Lee dives head-first into a maelstrom of racial and social ills\, using as his springboard the hottest day of the year on one block in Brooklyn\, NY. Three businesses dominate the block: a storefront radio station\, where a smooth-talkin' deejay (Samuel L. Jackson) spins the platters that matter; a convenience store owned by a Korean couple; and Sal's Famous Pizzeria\, the only white-operated business in the neighborhood. Sal (Danny Aiello) serves up slices with his two sons\, genial Vito (Richard Edson) and angry\, racist Pino (John Turturro). Sal has one black employee\, Mookie (Spike Lee)\, who wants to ""get paid"" but lacks ambition. His sister Jade (Joie Lee\, Spike's sister)\, who has a greater sense of purpose and a ""real"" job\, wants Mookie to start dealing with his responsibilities\, most notably his son with girlfriend Tina (Rosie Perez). Two of Mookie's best friends are Radio Raheem (Bill Nunn)\, a monolith of a man who rarely speaks\, preferring to blast Public Enemy's rap song Fight The Power on his massive boom box; and Buggin' Out (Giancarlo Esposito)\, nicknamed for his coke-bottle glasses and habit of losing his cool. When Buggin' Out notes that Sal's ""Wall of Fame\,"" a photo gallery of famous Italian-Americans\, includes no people of color\, he eventually demands a neighborhood boycott\, on a day when tensions are already running high\, that incurs tragic consequences.

FILM DESCRIPTION: Orson Welles first feature film -- which he directed\, produced\, and co-wrote\, as well as playing the title role -- proved to be his most important and influential work\, a ground-breaking drama loosely based on the life of William Randolph Hearst which is frequently cited as the finest American film ever made. Aging newspaper magnate Charles Foster Kane (Orson Welles) dies in his sprawling Florida estate after uttering a single\, enigmatic final word -- ""Rosebud"" -- and newsreel producer Rawlston (Phil Van Zandt) sends reporter Jerry Thompson (William Alland) out with the assignment of uncovering the meaning behind the great man's dying thought. As Thompson interviews Kane's friends\, family\, and associates\, we learn the facts of Kane's eventful and ultimately tragic life: his abandonment by his parents (Agnes Moorehead and Harry Shannon) after he becomes the heir to a silver mine; his angry conflicts with his guardian\, master financier Walter Parks Thatcher (George Coulouris); his impulsive decision that ""it would be fun to run a newspaper"" with the help of school chum Jedediah Leland (Joseph Cotten) and loyal assistant Mr. Bernstein (Everett Sloane); his rise from scandal sheet publisher to the owner of America's largest and most influential newspaper chain; his marriage to socially prominent Emily Norton (Ruth Warrick)\, whose uncle is the President of the United States; Kane's ambitious bid for public office\, which is dashed along with his marriage when his opponent\, corrupt political boss Jim Gettys (Ray Collins)\, reveals that Kane is having an affair with aspiring vocalist Susan Alexander (Dorothy Comingore); Kane's vain attempts to promote second wife Alexander as an opera star; and his final\, self-imposed exile to a massive and never-completed pleasure palace called Xanadu. While Citizen Kane was a film full of distinguished debuts -- along with Welles\, it was the first feature for Joseph Cotten\, Everett Sloane\, Ray Collins\, Agnes Moorehead\, and Ruth Warrick -- the only Academy Award it received was for Best Original Screenplay\, for which Welles shared credit with veteran screenwriter Herman Mankiewicz.

FILM DESCRIPTION: Tina Fey from Saturday Night Live wrote and appears in this comedy about the alternately funny and terrifying pecking order among teenage girls. Cady Heron (Lindsay Lohan) is a 15-year-old girl who has spent most of her life in Africa\, where she was home-schooled by her zoologist parents. When her family relocates to the United States\, Cady finds herself attending a high school in suburban Illinois\, where she gets a crash course in the various sub-strata of the student body: the jocks\, the cheerleaders\, the stoners\, the ""cool"" kids\, and so on. Much to her surprise\, Cady finds herself embraced by a clique of rich and popular girls known to outsiders as ""the Plastics\,"" led by Regina George (Rachel McAdams)\, Gretchen Weiners (Lacey Chabert)\, and Karen Smith (Amanda Seyfried). While Cady is grateful for her new friends\, it doesn't take long for her to realize how manipulative they can be\, and she soon discovers she's violated an unwritten law when she goes out on a date with Aaron (Jonathan Bennett)\, who is charming\, good looking...and Regina's former boyfriend. It isn't long before Regina and her pals are on the warpath\, and Cady must face a level of vengeful behavior for which years in the jungle never prepared her. Joining Tina Fey in the supporting cast are fellow SNL players Amy Poehler\, Ana Gasteyer\, and Tim Meadows. The screenplay for Mean Girls was based in part on Queen Bees and Wannabes: Helping Your Daughter Survive Cliques\, Gossip\, Boyfriends and Other Realities of Adolescence\, a book by professional youth counselor Rosalind Wiseman.

FILM DESCRIPTION: Operating under the assumption that by procuring alcohol for an upcoming party they will finally be able to break their longstanding losing streak with the fairer sex\, socially inept high school seniors Evan (Michael Cera) and Seth (Jonah Hill) set out to secure the adult beverages that could get them off of the geek list before they even attend college orientation. Evan is a bright young student whose outward sweetness belies his suffocating fear of heading off to college without his lifelong best friend Seth -- a hormone-driven mischief-maker who wasn't accepted to the same school as Evan. But Evan and Seth both know that college is a place of personal reinvention\, and that if they are able to make that first leap together they will have forged a bond powerful enough to last a lifetime. Meanwhile\, Evan and Seth's friend Fogell (Christopher Mintz-Plasse) acquires a hastily rendered fake I.D. that instantly endears him to a pair of truly irresponsible cops (Bill Hader and Seth Rogen). Penned by co-star Rogen in collaboration with former Da Ali G Show co-writer Evan Goldberg\, the semi-autobiographical SuperBad was produced by Judd Apatow and directed by Greg Mottola -- who previously helmed episodes of Undeclared and Arrested Development.

Spider-Man follows the template of the original Stan Lee/Steve Ditko source material\, with hero Peter Parker an orphaned\, intellectual teen loner living in Queens with his aunt (Rosemary Harris) and uncle (Cliff Robertson)\, and dreaming of the girl next door\, Mary Jane (Kirsten Dunst). On a field trip to a Columbia University lab\, Peter is bitten by a genetically altered spider and overnight he gains superhuman strength\, agility\, and perception. At first\, Peter uses his powers for material gain\, winning a wrestling match with a purportedly lucrative prize. But when Peter apathetically fails to stop a burglar from robbing the wrestling arena\, a tragedy follows that compels him to devote his powers to fighting crime -- as the superhero Spider-Man. When he's not busy fighting crime in a spider suit\, Peter moves into an apartment with his best friend\, Harry (James Franco)\, and begins work as a photographer at the Daily Bugle. Meanwhile\, his do-gooder alter ego finds a nemesis in the form of the Green Goblin (Willem Dafoe)\, a super-powered\, megalomaniacal villain who happens to be the alter ego of Harry's father\, weapons-manufacturing mogul Norman Osborn. Spider-Man was written by the prolific blockbuster scribe David Koepp (Jurassic Park\, Panic Room).

FILM DESCRIPTION: Based on the book Matilda\, by British children's author Roald Dahl\, this film moves the setting from the U.K. to the U.S.; otherwise it follows the original closely. Matilda Wormwood (Mara Wilson) is an extremely curious and intelligent little girl who is very different from her low-brow\, mainstream parents (Danny DeVito and real-life wife Rhea Perlman)\, who quite cruelly ignore her. As she grows older\, she begins to discover that she has telekinetic powers. Not until a teacher shows her kindness for the first time does she realize that she can use those powers to do something about her sufferings and help her friends as well. Villains from the awful Miss Trunchbull (Pam Ferris)\, headmistress of her miserable school Crunchem Hall\, to her parents and older brother begin to feel her ire. Look for Paul Reubens (aka Pee Wee Herman) in a small part as an FBI agent investigating Matilda's shady father.

FILM DESCRIPTION: Director John Singleton's debut chronicles the trials and tribulations of three young African-American males growing up in South Central Los Angeles. When young Tre (Cuba Gooding Jr.)\, a bright underachiever\, begins to show signs of trouble\, his struggling professional mother (Angela Basset) sends him to live with his father (Lawrence Fishburne)\, a hard-nosed\, no-nonsense disciplinarian. There he befriends Ricky (Morris Chestnut)\, a burgeoning football star\, and Doughboy (Ice Cube\, in a standout performance)\, a would-be gang banger. Over the years\, each chooses his own path: Tre seems bound for college; Ricky is a blue-chip running back with his pick of schools; Doughboy is a dope dealer and bona fide gangster who drifts in and out of the county juvenile facility. All is well until\, without warning\, a rival gang chases down Tre and Ricky with tragic results. Doughboy immediately prepares for revenge\, forcing Tre to decide whether to jeopardize his future and\, perhaps\, his life for the price of revenge and self-respect. Sometimes riveting\, Boyz'N the Hood is not without its problems. The film tries to cram every single issue facing the black community into an hour and a half of screen time\, making the film seem at times forced. The symbolism seems forced as well\, and the film is often unbearably heavy-handed. Also\, the characterization often relies on cardboard cut-outs; every white character in the film is a one-dimensional bigot\, and the black police officer with whom Tre and his father deal is even worse than his Caucasian counterparts. Still\, the unevenness of the film is redeemed by some moments of true brilliance.

FILM DESCRIPTION: Animation producer Don Bluth's fondness for overly cutesy characters and muddy color compositions work to the benefit of his feature-length cartoon The Land Before Time. Littlefoot\, a brontosaurus child\, must fend for himself when his mother is killed (shades of Bambi). With several other orphaned dinosaurs\, Littlefoot seeks out the fabled Great Valley\, where food and shelter is plentiful. Along the way\, the kiddie dinos learn several vital (and politically correct) life lessons\, all the while keeping themselves scarce whenever the fierce tyrannosauri gallumph into view. The cuteness of the characters (emphasized by the voice work) takes some of the harsh edges off the story\, which makes the film eminently suitable for younger children; and the smeary color design is ideal for the time-frame of the film\, which is set in the turbulent\, nature-run-rampant period just before the dinosaurs died out. Apparently they didn't all die\, inasmuch as a Land Before Time sequel was released on video in 1994. The earlier film inspired a 1988 Saturday morning cartoon series produced by Ruby-Spears\, Dink: The Little Dinosaur.

FILM DESCRIPTION: Based on a true story\, Steven Spielberg's Schindler's List stars Liam Neeson as Oskar Schindler\, a German businessman in Poland who sees an opportunity to make money from the Nazis' rise to power. He starts a company to make cookware and utensils\, using flattery and bribes to win military contracts\, and brings in accountant and financier Itzhak Stern (Ben Kingsley) to help run the factory. By staffing his plant with Jews who've been herded into Krakow's ghetto by Nazi troops\, Schindler has a dependable unpaid labor force. For Stern\, a job in a war-related plant could mean survival for himself and the other Jews working for Schindler. However\, in 1942\, all of Krakow's Jews are assigned to the Plaszow Forced Labor Camp\, overseen by Commandant Amon Goeth (Ralph Fiennes)\, an embittered alcoholic who occasionally shoots prisoners from his balcony. Schindler arranges to continue using Polish Jews in his plant\, but\, as he sees what is happening to his employees\, he begins to develop a conscience. He realizes that his factory (now refitted to manufacture ammunition) is the only thing preventing his staff from being shipped to the death camps. Soon Schindler demands more workers and starts bribing Nazi leaders to keep Jews on his employee lists and out of the camps. By the time Germany falls to the allies\, Schindler has lost his entire fortune -- and saved 1\,100 people from likely death. Schindler's List was nominated for 12 Academy Awards and won seven\, including Best Picture and a long-coveted Best Director for Spielberg\, and it quickly gained praise as one of the finest American movies about the Holocaust.

FILM DESCRIPTION: Director David Fincher's dark\, stylish thriller ranks as one of the decade's most influential box-office successes. Set in a hellish vision of a New York-like city\, where it is always raining and the air crackles with impending death\, the film concerns Det. William Somerset (Morgan Freeman)\, a homicide specialist just one week from a well-deserved retirement. Every minute of his 32 years on the job is evident in Somerset's worn\, exhausted face\, and his soul aches with the pain that can only come from having seen and felt far too much. But Somerset's retirement must wait for one last case\, for which he is teamed with young hotshot David Mills (Brad Pitt)\, the fiery detective set to replace him at the end of the week. Mills has talked his reluctant wife\, Tracy (Gwyneth Paltrow)\, into moving to the big city so that he can tackle important cases\, but his first and Somerset's last are more than either man has bargained for. A diabolical serial killer is staging grisly murders\, choosing victims representing the seven deadly sins. First\, an obese man is forced to eat until his stomach ruptures to represent gluttony\, then a wealthy defense lawyer is made to cut off a pound of his own flesh as penance for greed. Somerset initially refuses to take the case\, realizing that there will be five more murders\, ghastly sermons about lust\, sloth\, pride\, wrath\, and envy presented by a madman to a sinful world. Somerset is correct\, and something within him cannot let the case go\, forcing the weary detective to team with Mills and see the case to its almost unspeakably horrible conclusion. The moody photography is by Darius Khondji; the nauseatingly vivid special effects are by makeup artist Rob Bottin\, best known for more fantasy-oriented work in films like The Howling (1981).

FILM DESCRIPTION: Less a parody of the early James Bond film than a parody of the films that parodied the early James Bond films\, Austin Powers: International Man of Mystery stars Mike Myers as Austin Powers\, by day a hipster fashion photographer in mid-'60s swingin' London and by night a crime-fighting secret agent. Austin's wardrobe is pure Carnaby Street at its most outrageous\, his vocabulary is crowded by the cool lingo of the day (""Groovy\, baby! Yeah!!"")\, and he's irresistible to women\, despite the fact that he can be charitably described as ""stocky"" and has teeth that strike fear into any practicing dentist. When his nemesis\, the arch-enemy Dr. Evil (also played by Myers)\, has himself cryogenically frozen and sent into space\, Powers also has himself put on ice so he can be thawed out when Dr. Evil returns. Come 1997\, Dr. Evil returns to Earth and is back to his old tricks\, so Austin is thawed out and returned to active service -- though he soon discovers his style doesn't play so well 30 years on. The supporting cast includes Elizabeth Hurley as Austin's sidekick\, Vanessa Kensington; Michael York as his boss\, Basil Exposition; Robert Wagner as Dr. Evil's assistant\, Number Two; and Seth Green as Dr. Evil's troubled son\, Scott Evil. Ming Tea\, the swingin' pop band that periodically backs up Austin\, includes real life pop-rockers Matthew Sweet and Susanna Hoffs. Austin Powers: International Man of Mystery was a mild box-office hit but an even bigger success on home video\, which led to the 1999 sequel\, Austin Powers: The Spy Who Shagged Me.

FILM DESCRIPTION: A disaffected man seeks a sense of identity in one of the key films of Hollywood's 1970s New Wave. Once a promising pianist from a family of classical musicians\, Bobby Eroica Dupea (Jack Nicholson\, in his first major starring role) leads a blue-collar life as an oil rigger\, living with needy waitress girlfriend Rayette (Karen Black) and bowling with their friends Elton (Billy ""Green"" Bush) and Stoney (Fannie Flagg). Feeling suffocated by responsibilities\, Bobby seeks out his sister\, Tita (Lois Smith)\, and\, discovering that his father is gravely ill\, he reluctantly heads back to the patrician family compound in Puget Sound with a pregnant Rayette in tow. After a road trip featuring a harangue from hitchhiker Palm (Helena Kallianiotes) about filth\, and Bobby's ill-fated attempt to make a menu substitution in a diner\, he tucks Rayette away in a motel before heading to the house. There Bobby seduces his uptight brother Carl's cultured fiancée\, Catherine (Susan Anspach)\, but Rayette shows up unexpectedly. As Rayette's crassness collides with the snobbery of the Dupea circle\, Bobby loses patience with both sides. After trying to reconcile with his mute father\, Bobby departs\, unwilling to give in to either destiny. Director Bob Rafelson and screenwriter Adrien Joyce (aka Carole Eastman) used the creative control afforded by the low budget to craft a European-influenced character study\, catching a cultural mood of anomie and resentment as it was embodied in Bobby. Neither older generation nor hippie\, Bobby fits in nowhere\, and his desire for independence conflicts with his emotional emptiness. Nicholson's nuanced performance of simmering frustration resonated with 1970 audiences caught between Nixon's ""silent majority"" and the troubled counterculture; a substantial hit\, Five Easy Pieces was nominated for several Oscars\, including Best Picture and Best Actor\, and established Nicholson as a star. Offering no ""easy"" answers to Bobby's existential crisis\, Five Easy Pieces is one of the pre-eminent films in the early-'70s cycle of alienated American art movies\, as even the fantasy of rebellion is reduced to merely running away.

In the early 1900s\, the child Vito flees his Sicilian village for America after the local Mafia kills his family. Vito (Robert De Niro) struggles to make a living\, legally or illegally\, for his wife and growing brood in Little Italy\, killing the local Black Hand Fanucci (Gastone Moschin) after he demands his customary cut of the tyro's business. With Fanucci gone\, Vito's communal stature grows\, but it is his family (past and present) who matters most to him -- a familial legacy then upended by Michael's (Al Pacino) business expansion in the 1950s. Now based in Lake Tahoe\, Michael conspires to make inroads in Las Vegas and Havana pleasure industries by any means necessary. As he realizes that allies like Hyman Roth (Lee Strasberg) are trying to kill him\, the increasingly paranoid Michael also discovers that his ambition has crippled his marriage to Kay (Diane Keaton) and turned his brother\, Fredo (John Cazale)\, against him. Barely escaping a federal indictment\, Michael turns his attention to dealing with his enemies\, completing his own corruption.

FILM DESCRIPTION: After parodying the blaxploitation films of the 1970s in I'm Gonna Git You Sucka\, Keenen Ivory Wayans takes aim at slasher films of the 1980s and 1990s in this raunchy satire\, which was produced under the clumsy but inarguably appropriate title Scream If You Know What I Did Last Halloween. As you might expect\, a group of teenagers -- not-terribly-bright Buffy (Shannon Elizabeth)\, her best friend Brenda (Regina Hall)\, stoner Shorty (Marlon Wayans)\, fey football player Ray (Shawn Wayans)\, loudmouthed Greg (Lochlyn Munro)\, sexually overexcited Bobby (Jon Abrahams)\, and his prim girlfriend Cindy (Anna Faris) -- are on the run from a maniacal killer who is looking for revenge after the kids accidentally kill a man following an auto accident. They also find themselves having to contend with intrusive reporter Gail Hailstorm (Cheri Oteri) and eccentric high school principal Squiggly (David L. Lander). Incidentally\, the title Scary Movie is something of an inside joke: it was the working title for Scream\, the movie that kick-started the mid-'90s slasher film revival.

Spider-Man follows the template of the original Stan Lee/Steve Ditko source material\, with hero Peter Parker an orphaned\, intellectual teen loner living in Queens with his aunt (Rosemary Harris) and uncle (Cliff Robertson)\, and dreaming of the girl next door\, Mary Jane (Kirsten Dunst). On a field trip to a Columbia University lab\, Peter is bitten by a genetically altered spider and overnight he gains superhuman strength\, agility\, and perception. At first\, Peter uses his powers for material gain\, winning a wrestling match with a purportedly lucrative prize. But when Peter apathetically fails to stop a burglar from robbing the wrestling arena\, a tragedy follows that compels him to devote his powers to fighting crime -- as the superhero Spider-Man. When he's not busy fighting crime in a spider suit\, Peter moves into an apartment with his best friend\, Harry (James Franco)\, and begins work as a photographer at the Daily Bugle. Meanwhile\, his do-gooder alter ego finds a nemesis in the form of the Green Goblin (Willem Dafoe)\, a super-powered\, megalomaniacal villain who happens to be the alter ego of Harry's father\, weapons-manufacturing mogul Norman Osborn. Spider-Man was written by the prolific blockbuster scribe David Koepp (Jurassic Park\, Panic Room).

FILM DESCRIPTION: Popularly viewed as one of the best American films ever made\, the multi-generational crime saga The Godfather is a touchstone of cinema: one of the most widely imitated\, quoted\, and lampooned movies of all time. Marlon Brando and Al Pacino star as Vito Corleone and his youngest son\, Michael\, respectively. It is the late 1940s in New York and Corleone is\, in the parlance of organized crime\, a ""godfather"" or ""don\,"" the head of a Mafia family. Michael\, a free thinker who defied his father by enlisting in the Marines to fight in World War II\, has returned a captain and a war hero. Having long ago rejected the family business\, Michael shows up at the wedding of his sister\, Connie (Talia Shire)\, with his non-Italian girlfriend\, Kay (Diane Keaton)\, who learns for the first time about the family ""business."" A few months later at Christmas time\, the don barely survives being shot by gunmen in the employ of a drug-trafficking rival whose request for aid from the Corleones' political connections was rejected. After saving his father from a second assassination attempt\, Michael persuades his hotheaded eldest brother\, Sonny (James Caan)\, and family advisors Tom Hagen (Robert Duvall) and Sal Tessio (Abe Vigoda) that he should be the one to exact revenge on the men responsible. After murdering a corrupt police captain and the drug trafficker\, Michael hides out in Sicily while a gang war erupts at home. Falling in love with a local girl\, Michael marries her\, but she is later slain by Corleone enemies in an attempt on Michael's life. Sonny is also butchered\, having been betrayed by Connie's husband. As Michael returns home and convinces Kay to marry him\, his father recovers and makes peace with his rivals\, realizing that another powerful don was pulling the strings behind the narcotics endeavor that began the gang warfare. Once Michael has been groomed as the new don\, he leads the family to a new era of prosperity\, then launches a campaign of murderous revenge against those who once tried to wipe out the Corleones\, consolidating his family's power and completing his own moral downfall. Nominated for 11 Academy Awards and winning for Best Picture\, Best Actor (Marlon Brando)\, and Best Adapted Screenplay\, The Godfather was followed by a pair of sequels.

FILM DESCRIPTION: Both a classic movie for kids and a remarkable portrait of childhood\, E.T. is a sci-fi adventure that captures that strange moment in youth when the world is a place of mysterious possibilities (some wonderful\, some awful)\, and the universe seems somehow separate from the one inhabited by grown-ups. Henry Thomas plays Elliott\, a young boy living with his single mother (Dee Wallace)\, his older brother Michael (Robert MacNaughton)\, and his younger sister Gertie (Drew Barrymore). Elliott often seems lonely and out of sorts\, lost in his own world. One day\, while looking for something in the back yard\, he senses something mysterious in the woods watching him. And he's right: an alien spacecraft on a scientific mission mistakenly left behind an aging botanist who isn't sure how to get home. Eventually Elliott puts his fears aside and makes contact with the ""little squashy guy\,"" perhaps the least threatening alien invader ever to hit a movie screen. As Elliott tries to keep the alien under wraps and help him figure out a way to get home\, he discovers that the creature can communicate with him telepathically. Soon they begin to learn from each other\, and Elliott becomes braver and less threatened by life. E.T. rigs up a communication device from junk he finds around the house\, but no one knows if he'll be rescued before a group of government scientists gets hold of him. In 2002\, Steven Spielberg re-released E.T. The Extra-Terrestrial in a revised edition\, with several deleted scenes restored and digitally refurbished special effects.

6SkpvlcsdRk,Woodworking,2016-10-20T09:30:00Z,Make Your Own Thin Rip Push Jig for a Table Saw,"Visit our blog at: http://www.workshopaddict.com/tools/  Ripping thin stock on the table saw can be a dangerous operation if you don't have the proper safety accessories and protocol. For discussion purposes\, we are going to classify ""thin stock"" as any material under 1.5"" wide. When cutting material on the table saw with the fence so close to the blade\, there isn't any room for your fingers to safely push the material through the saw. The use of an accessory to push the material through the saw is the safest way to complete the job. You can purchase a factory made accessory from multiple companies or make your own! Thin stock accessories - There are many options and styles of accessories to push material through a table saw. You have your standard push stick\, Microjig GRIPPER\, and various other store bought/shop made designs that push the material through and also hold the material down.  We have nearly everyone of these in the shop now\, or at least have tried them in the past. Some styles work better for others and other are completely wrong for certain tasks.  The biggest draw back from these other safety accessories\, is they are able to be put anywhere on the table saw and the operator has to consciously place it in a location where it won't get hit by the saw and keep it in that location when pushing the material through the saw. That is where our simple jig shines!    Take advantage of your table saw fence  The table saw has a sturdy fence that is in the same place in relationship to your material when you use the saw. Your material runs along it at all times\, we can use this to our advantage!  The jig we created is super simple. It consists of three (3) pieces that wrap around the fence and a fourth (4th) piece that plays the role of the handle. The concept is super simple\, the jig rides along the fence and is restricted to the path of the fence. The user doesn't need to worry about the location of the accessory in relationship to the blade when he/she is placing it on the their workpiece or while pushing the material through.  To use the jig\, you simply place it over the fence when you are mid way through your cut and push it away from the front of the saw and past the blade. The sides of the jig (that wrap around the fence) act as your push stick. They catch the material and push it past the blade. Meanwhile your hand is safely on the handle away from the spinning blade.  Simple construction  The construction can't be any easier. With two sides\, top\, and a handle this jig can be made within 20 minutes using up that scrap you have been keeping around the shop.  Our first iteration of the jig consisted of all 1/2"" MDF pieces. After using the jig a bit\, we realized we could replace one side with a thinner side (we used 1/8"" hardboard) and that would allow us to get even closer to the blade without sacrificing any strength or safety.  The joints on this jigs were butt joints tacked in placed with CA glue and then pre drilled and had 3 screws per joint. It is important to use pan head screws or add a washer to the screws when securing the hardboard. There is not enough thickness for a countersink and maintaining its strength.",WorkshopAddict,"['table saw jig', 'diy jigsaw table', 'workshopaddict', 'workshop addict', 'table saw jig thin cut', 'jig thin cut', 'rip thin stock', 'rip', 'woodworking', 'wood', 'jig', 'ripping', 'jigs', 'table saw', 'diy', 'tablesaw', 'safe woodworking with jigs', 'woodworking for beginners', 'making jigs', 'how to make a jig', 'make a jig', 'jig making', 'tablesaw jig', 'tablesaw jigs', 'thin rip', 'thin ripping', 'table saw thin rip guide', 'accessories for woodworking', 'thin rip cuts', 'thin strip ripping']",26,en,PT4M3S,hd,false,True,65028,1276,0,33,False,"['https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hobby', 'https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lifestyle_(sociology)']",en,

SUBSCRIBE to This Old House: http://bit.ly/SubscribeThisOldHouse  Cost: Varies  Steps:  1. The terms hardwood and softwood do not refer to density but rather to the type of tree- hardwoods come from deciduous trees and softwoods from conifers. 2. Softwoods grow fast and straight so they are a good option for framing material like fir and spruce.  The less knots\, the stronger the wood.  These woods are typically dried in a kiln to prevent warping and shrinkage. 3. Some softwoods like pine are inexpensive and can be used for interior trim\, but they can warp and twist. 4. A hardwood like maple is used for cabinets whereas oak is a good choice for flooring.  Both of these are more common hardwoods. 5. Fine hardwoods are denser and include species like walnut and mahogany.  They’re used for balusters and decking and are more expensive than common hardwoods. 6. Exotic hardwoods like purple heart and zebra wood are the most expensive and usually used for accents on fine furniture.

They had 2 quality levels; the OriginCal and the EZCal. I tried both. 5 Years later\, what do I think? I actually still use the OriginCal as my Go-To caliper. Being only $39 I don't have to worry about it too much\, and it has never let me down. The EXCal\, which I gave 1st place in the under $30 category\, was as good as the Neiko or Pittsburgh (harbor freight) but it ended up having battery door issues just like the Mitutoyo. Final Conclusion: But the iGaging OriginCal. If you have double the money to spend\, buy the Mitutoyo.  ~~Video Details~~ Here it is. The Showdown video. Which calipers are up to snuff and get my recommendation?  7 different digital calipers were tested multiple times at set points along their measuring faces to get an average accuracy and repeatability value.   In all of this data gathering it became very clear which digital calipers are worth your consideration.   Whether you depend on a quality digital caliper everyday in an engineering/shop environment\, or you just need a caliper every once in a while\, accuracy and precision are really important. You need to be able to trust the measurements you get from your caliper. I'm going to tell you which ones you can depend on\, that won't break the bank.

WEOVKmh9dFY,Woodworking,2017-08-23T23:03:36Z,34 - Learn How to Make RAISED PANEL DOORS With solid wood. easy step by step.,"How to make and install Raised Panel doors from any lumber.  I’ve had a number of viewers ask me how to build cabinets\, and raised panel doors. This is the first video in that series that I will make where I will give detailed instructions on just how that is done.  Using these methods\, you can save as much as $10\,000 - $15\,000 on replacing your kitchen cabinets. The kitchen is the single best upgrade you can do to a home. And cabinets are really a very straight-forward woodworking project. Even if you purchased every single tool needed for a full shop to build cabinets\, you would still save substantially over purchasing cabinets from a company. I have helped many people get into woodworking and set up a shop using this route.  This project will require a router table. But it doesn’t have to cost much. Many of my viewers have built their own. You can also get them pre-made for you in a kit\, and they have very high precision. In this video\, I am building a set of three raised panel doors that I am making in solid walnut. They are for an aquarium stand for my oldest daughter. I will show step by step every single part of the procedure from the first cut of the lumber to the last part; installation of the door itself. These are the identical doors that are used in high end kitchen and bathroom cabinetry. They also work wonderfully for many other pieces of fine furniture\, and even items like jewelry box lids.  This video will include the milling of the stock and the making of the raised panel center pieces\, and joining up boards to get to the necessary width. It also includes the making of the rails and stiles\, and how to set up the required cuts for those on the router table. Finally\, it covers assembly\, and glue up as well as how to set up and install hinges\, and mount the doors.

8h4OJHhSH8A,Woodworking,2018-01-06T05:24:50Z,Make Professional Push Sticks for Workshop Safety,"DO NOT USE REMAINING FINGERS AS PUSHSTICKS!! Learn why I prefer 'handle style' pushsticks at Next Level Carpentry and how you can make a batch of them using a simple pattern routing method.  Then remember the most important piece of advice for using pushsticks: ""KEEP BETWEEN FINGERS AND BLADE!!"" whenever  you're working with power tools. Even if you don't need to make pushsticks\, learning how to make patterns for routing complex curves is useful for a wide variety of other woodworking projects.  The video is on the long side because I packed it full of useful methods and tips for making routing patterns from MDF scrap along with a few bonus tips and techniques I tossed in.  Learn 'how to coil a bandsaw blade' and what I use to keep dust from sticking to lenses on my glasses.  There's a couple product recommendations slipped in to the video as well.

Instead of buying a new one\, he wants to recycle this old piece of furniture to save money and fix it up to last a lifetime.   Minwax® expert Bruce Johnson walks us through a simple\, three-step wood finishing process to help Dave with his project : - Start by sanding the wood with 120-grit\, then moving to a 220-grit sandpaper. - Use a pre-stain wood conditioner to ensure the stain applies and dries evenly\, without blotches. - Apply a wood stain in your favorite shade with a natural bristle brush\, along the direction of the grain. - Add a coat of clear protective finish for that extra bit of shine and long-lasting protection.

The first part takes a look at my tablesaw workbench. The second part is about preparing a top surface using particle board. The remainder of the video is about building a 30”x48”x36” work bench. The T-leg design can also be adapted to make a cabinet or a table. Please enjoy!   Printouts: Cut list ► https://postimg.cc/image/ankc6ef3n/ Dimensions ► https://postimg.cc/image/9jajcs21v/  Some pros and cons to using a particle board work surface: Particle board falls apart if it gets wet. And it's not very strong. So why on Earth would I choose to use it? Well\, aside from the fact that it's cheap\, it's a nice work surface that's also surprisingly easy to repair. I mean\, I've kept that piece on my tablesaw for ten years! The secret is to clean up wet spills quickly\, and to fill in knife cuts periodically. When you have a thick coat of polyurethane built up\, it will resist moisture quite well. But where there are knife cuts\, moisture will affect it quickly. Have you ever been scratched by a cat? The skin gets a little puffy right around the scratch: a particle board surface will do something just like that where it has been exposed to moisture. When too many of those little puffy scratches show up\, you simply sand the surface down with a block\, and then re-coat it with poly. About once every two or three months\, I will true the surface using a half-piece of granite floor tile that has some sandpaper stuck to it by spray-adhesive. Then I will wipe down the surface with mineral spirits\, and re-coat it with polyurethane. It probably sounds worse than it is ;)  ***** Chapters~  0:00 Tablesaw 5:17 Prep 7:40 Sheet goods 9:56 Top 12:25 Plan 13:42 Legs 16:18 Frame 1 19:11 Frame 2 21:32 Details 23:25 Surfaces 24:16 Design 26:37 Scale Model  ***** Music: ""Samba Isobel"" and “Silver Flame” Kevin MacLeod (incompetech.com) Licensed under Creative Commons: By Attribution 3.0 License http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/3.0",pocket83,"['woodworking', 'carpentry', 'wood', 'diy', 'tips', 'tricks', 'router', 'table', 'saw', 'lathe', 'turning', 'miter', 'mitre', 'sander', 'making', 'make', 'homemade', 'engineering', 'geometry', 'math', 'planer', 'jigsaw', 'bandsaw', 'drill', 'press', 'scroll', 'jig', 'workbench', 'work bench', 'shop', 'bench', 'pocket83', 'cabinet', '2x4', 'plywood', 't-leg', 'design', 'build', 'particle board']",26,en,PT28M18S,hd,false,True,54993,2125,0,240,False,"['https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hobby', 'https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lifestyle_(sociology)']",,

Jw1Eyu54whI,Woodworking,2016-04-08T15:06:49Z,Making a cubic trefoil knot from solid wood,"This video follows the process of making a trefoil knot from a solid wooden cube. The object has no purpose- other than to create wonder when viewed\, or to serve as a display of the wide range for possibility.    ***** The shape is undoubtedly complex\, and so it can quickly become confusing to make one; it is difficult to recreate a shape that you do not first understand. To overcome this obstacle\, I use a very simple approach: My goal is to reduce its complexity into a series of simpler constituent steps. At first\, the cube consists of 343 little sub-cubes (because 7³ = 343). The task is to remove any cubes that are not part of the design.  Along each step\, the cubes that can be removed are\, much as a reductive artist (such as a sculptor) would do. So now if you imagine our completed trefoil as a continuous string of 48 cubes\, we simply must free the 295 cubes that surround it. We only take the cubes that we are certain we can take\, so that each step is a step that we understand the purpose of. Understand the parts\, and you will understand the whole (at least in this case).  ***** With respect to its finish: I am well aware that it could be shinier and more attention-grabbing. I could have lacquered it to 'wow' viewers in the reveal\, but I wanted it to look genuine. It has a few flaws\, but there are no tricks; this thing was actually carved out of a solid block\, and you can tell that when you look at it.    ***** Orthographic limitation: According to our orthographic template\, after the table-saw actions were complete\, the object was done. This was not the case. Additional information was still needed to proceed. The mathematical reasons for this are complex and numerous\, but the simple fact is such: Orthographic maps are incomplete tools that serve only to aid in human understanding. Much is missing\, but our tools must have limits in their design\, because we have limits. We lack the processing power to also incorporate a wire-frame isometric model of the object into the existing (simplified) model already in our heads. I am not belittling our intelligence; I find it amazing that I am capable of rotating an imaginary colored cube in my head\, and that ability has been enough for me to get by.  Here is a model that will more clearly expose orthographic limitation to you. Imagine a blueprint with views along the X\,Y\, and Z axes (front\, side and top). The blueprint looks the same in every picture: A circle. It would be natural to conclude that the object is a sphere. But a cylinder would still look like a circle from the end\, so imagine cutting out a cylinder along all three planes- the finished object would not be a ball at all. It would still have edges! Our psychology likes to fill in the gaps of what we don't know with assumptions based on our past experiences\, and this usually works. But it can be tricked\, so we would do well to stay aware of it.

In this video\, the guys walk us through the construction\, features\, and uses.  The lightweight sled design makes cutting large workpieces on the table saw a snap. The rock-solid fence ensures square cuts every time — with easy to adjust controls to make setup quick and simple. The versatile design lets you add a variety of accessories\, like a flip stop\, ruler\, and a box joint jig\, and the adjustable\, zero-clearance base means cleaner cuts with less chipout for standard kerfs or dadoes. We've also included plans for building an optional fence extension to help with extra-long boards.  ***Note: For those with a keen eye\, you may have noticed that the sled in this video and the photos from our plans are mirror images of each other.  This sled was originally designed for a right-tilt table saw. If your blade tilts to the left\, like the majority of newer saws and the table saw shown in the video\, you’ll need to make a mirror image of the sled shown in the plans. This is so the sliding base can open up in the direction in which your dado blades will stack to accommodate for a wide range of dado blade widths.***  Project Materials and Sources: IPG Double-Sided Tape: https://amzn.to/2xqCdE2 ; Kreg Jig and Fixture Bar: https://amzn.to/2wBs8ny ; Kreg Swing Stop Block: https://amzn.to/3c3U7vc;   Kreg Self-Adhesive Measuring Tape L-R: https://amzn.to/2y6j0rm ; Kreg Self-Adhesive Measuring Tape R-L: https://amzn.to/2wuI8HM ;  Kreg Top Trak 48"": https://amzn.to/3efx5mZ ; Kreg Top Trak 24"": https://amzn.to/3cfeFkz  Subscribe to Woodsmith to receive tips\, plans\, projects\, and techniques both in print and video.

Well we have one for you. The concept: relativity. That strange fantastic relationship between time\, distance\, and mass. Before we're finished\, I think you'll agree that truth is stranger than the strangest fiction.  Why do the stars shine? Why does the galaxy light up?  E equals MC squared That is the engine that lights up the stars Energy turns into mass E equals MC squared -  That is the secret of the stars  Now listen carefully: The faster you move THe heavier you get The energy of motion turns into M\, your mass Energy of motion  Energy equals Mass times the speed of light squared An awful lot of energy For a tiny amount of mass  Light travels at the same speed No matter how you look at it No matter how I move\, relative to you\, Light travels at the same speed  No matter who is doing the measurement And no matter what direction you are moving The speed of light is the same No matter what direction\, or how fast  As you travel faster Time slows down Everything slows down  Time slows down when you move Time passes at a different rate Clocks run slow It's a monumental shift in how we see the world  The beauty\, the majesty\, The power of the universe Into a single equation  (refrain)  It's a beautiful piece of science It's a beautifuly elegant theory It's a beautiful piece of science  A planet like the Earth is kept in orbit Because it follows curves In the spatial fabric caused By the sun's presence  Space and time are bent by stars and planets As things move through this curved space\, they bend  Now all of this is illustration of the fact that time and space are linked together.  As you're moving through bent and curved space and time\, You feel like you feel a force (x2) That force is gravity  (refrain)  That is the secret of the stars  Help us caption & translate this video!  https://amara.org/v/CoHM/",melodysheep,"['symphony', 'science', 'secret', 'stars', 'melodysheep', 'remix', 'einstein', 'e=mc2', 'relativity', 'autotune', 'kaku', 'brian', 'cox', 'degrasse tyson', 'energy', 'light', 'physics', 'space']",28,en,PT3M38S,hd,true,True,2949616,35736,0,2679,False,['https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Music'],,

How to feel different. How to feel new. Like science fiction bending truth.  No one can unring this bell\, unsound this alarm\, unbreak my heart new. God knows\, i am dissonance waiting to be swiftly pulled into tune.  I'll go anywhere you want\, anywhere you want\, anywhere you want me.  I know the further I go\, the harder I try\, only keeps my eyes closed. and somehow I've fallen in love with this middle ground at the cost of my soul.  Yet I know\, if I stepped aside\, released the controls\, you would open my eyes.

They were the brainchild of producer Claude Lemoine. The classic formation included Christian Le Bartz (vocals)\,  Alain Maratrat (guitar and keyboards)\, ""Little"" Gérard L'Her (bass and vocals)\, Fabrice Quagliotti (keyboards) and Alain Groetzinger (drums and percussion). They sold millions of records and had a string of  hits such as  ""On the Road Again"" (an inspired re-make of the Canned Heat song)\,  ""Galactica""\, ""Future Woman""\, ""Electric Delight""\, ""Space Rock"" and ""Ideomatic"" (most composed by L'Her and Maratrat).  Unlike their German contemporaries in electronic rock (Tangerine Dream\, Klaus Schulze and Popol Vuh)\, the Rockets were a massive live act\, famous for their spaceman costumes and silver make-up and for appearing in stadium venues with futuristic flying-saucer stage sets and laser light shows. Their brand of glam space rock has influenced artists such as Daft Punk\, Duck Sauce and Kiss.

Less than 25 minutes into the set they count down to 1976\, with lead singer Fee Waybill endlessly insisting that there is another minute-and-a-half to go and feigning a broken watch.  The Tubes had only released one record at the time of this recording\, 1975's The Tubes\, which was produced by Al Kooper. That record contained the derisive ""White Punks on Dope"" as well as the disco-rock sales pitch ""What Do You Want From Life."" Both songs contained ample background noise and bizarre vocals.  We are at some disadvantage being unable to see the stage show (we don't know why exactly the ""tube job"" during the sketch ""A Word From Our Sponsor"" is eliciting such whoops\, for example); but we can hear sketches like ""Sputnik\,"" a sort of interstellar sitcom\, and there's no mistaking the live marching band that covers Steve Miller Band's ""Living in the U.S.A."" after the New Year's firecrackers are done exploding. (Other notable cover choices include the Velvet Underground's ""I'm Waiting For The Man\,"" Tom Jones' ""It's Not Unusual\,"" and the ""Theme From I Love Lucy."")  From their debut record\, the Tubes play ""Up From The Deep\,"" Space Baby  ""Malaguena Salerosa\,"" ""Mondo Bondage\,"" ""Haloes\,"" and the aforementioned ""What Do You Want From Life"" and ""White Punks On Dope."" But they had been busy putting material together for six years at this point\, and had already prepared a good portion of material that would end up on their second record. From that album\, Young and Rich\, they play ""Tubes World Tour\,"" ""Slipped My Disco\,"" ""Stand Up And Shout\,"" and ""Proud To Be An American.  There is a load of vulgarity and fun throughout this show. And the long and irreverent program comes to a tee when Waybill puts on his ""Quay Lewd"" alter-ego and introduces his band as the Cocaine Piranhas.  The Tubes continue to tour today.",The Tubes on MV,"['The Tubes', 'Bill Graham', 'live music', 'music vault', 'San Francisco', 'Winterland', 'Space Baby']",10,,PT4M45S,sd,false,True,4039,47,0,2,False,"['https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Music', 'https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pop_music', 'https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rock_music', 'https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Soul_music']",,

FR7wOGyAzpw,Ancient Memes,2007-07-20T19:01:54Z,Fabulous Secret Powers,"So\, here's a little backstory on this video. This is the original video from which the ""HEHEYYEYAAEYAAAEYAEYAA"" / ""He-Man Sings"" meme was born. (FULL HISTORY IS BELOW)  We made this video in 2005 and posted it to the Something Awful forums: http://secretpowers.net/reddit/fsp_history.html  In 2006\, dkilzer2000 posted it to youtube: http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X8Nc8RCLy1s  We finally got around to posting it to our own page in 2007 (you are here).  Then\, in 2010\, in the process of redesigning our company web site\, we posted it to Vimeo: http://vimeo.com/8564338  We did not disable the ""Download the source video"" option on Vimeo\, nor did we leave our watermark on the video as we had on the YouTube version.  From Vimeo\, people grabbed the ""high quality"" version\, edited out the intro and outro (which included all of our credits)\, and posted it again to YouTube. As it turns out\, removing the intro and outro was a very smart and viral-y decision by ProtoOfSnagem and others\, because the video has gotten over 60M views in this abbreviated form. We tried for over a year to get ProtoOfSnagem to at least credit us for the video\, but he never responded  -- in fact\, it seemed to be a dead YouTube account -- so on 11/14/12 we flagged it and YouTube pulled it down\, along with over TWO YEARS of your comments. :(  On 11/15/12\, we retracted the claim on ProtoOfSnagem's version. Our only goal was to prompt Proto to credit us in his description\, but instead it just felt like we broke this joyful little corner of the Internet and made a lot of people sad. That is the OPPOSITE of what this video is all about.  11/16/12 -- ProtoOfSnagem's version returned to YouTube. We have no plans to pull it down again\, as we feel this video belongs to you\, the Internet Citizens\, at this point.  Since 2005\, there have been all manner of tributes\, remixes and even 5-10 hour loops of the video. We've collected our favorite tributes to Fabulous Secret Powers here:  http://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLXtM1K03stJo3vKejGKKUMqpuPbILVveF  All of this is to say\, we are extremely happy so many people have enjoyed this video over the years. And if you're here watching the original\, sitting through the smooth intro tones of my Yamaha DX7 (aka the Doogie Howser-o-matic\, which you can pry out of my cold\, dead hands) we appreciate you!
